# navigation
### Project Overview

This project was created as a way to practice the three different types of navigation provided by React Navigation:
1) Stack Navigators
2) Bottom Tab Navigators
3) Drawer Navigators

Included in this project is the use of nested navigators to show a basic workflow for implementing navigation through an application. Also, this project contains examples of Authentication flow. As well as, how to build a clean Rootstack that drives users through different screens of an app based on being signed in or not. The whole of the project was built using TypeScript and almost everything is typeguarded to the best of my ability. This was the firs time that I have used TypeScript with React Native to this extent so I am bound to get something wrong. 

If you like what you see, thank you in advance and give the repo a star. If you want to collaborate on something then drop me a line.
